Join Convoy for a Cause as we gear up for our most exciting rally yet - the Monterey Car Week 2025 Rally! This August, we're bringing together car enthusiasts, community leaders, and supporters for an unforgettable journey along the scenic California coastline.

Our rally will feature classic cars, modern supercars, and everything in between as we cruise through some of the most beautiful roads in California. But this isn't just about the cars - it's about coming together for a cause that matters. All proceeds from this event will benefit local children's charities in the Monterey Bay area.

The route will take us from Carmel-by-the-Sea through the famous 17-Mile Drive, with stops at iconic locations like Pebble Beach Golf Links and the Lone Cypress. Participants will enjoy a catered lunch overlooking the Pacific Ocean, live entertainment, and the chance to connect with fellow automotive enthusiasts who share a passion for giving back.

## Event Details

Registration opens this spring with early bird pricing available for the first 100 participants. Each rally entry includes a welcome package, official rally decals, route maps, lunch, and a commemorative photo session with your vehicle against the stunning Monterey coastline.

Whether you're driving a vintage Porsche, a modern Tesla, or your daily driver, all vehicles are welcome. What matters most is your commitment to making a positive impact in our community while celebrating our shared love of automobiles and the open road.
